# .NET Graphing Calculator
Emulates the basic functionalities of a graphing calculator's graphing window via a Windows Form application.  

## Features
- Capable of plotting a linear, quadratic, cubic, and circular function on the same viewing window.
- User can provide parameters to each function to change it's shape.
- Careful input invalidation to prevent unwanted results from the graph.
- The graph's viewing window can be changed by providing offsets away from the origin or zooming / shrinking.
- Capable of detecting when no functions are in scope of the viewing window, avoiding unnecessary draw calls and sampling if such is the case.
